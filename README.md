# AUF_sim
C++ code to create a simple simulator for under-actuated ships motion. 
The simulator is based on solving the ode of the system by using a Runge-Kutta method (RK4 from GSL library). 
The simulator is still under development. 
The output of the simulation (the solution of the ode) is plotted by a matlab scripts to simplify plotting phase. 
Matplotlibbcpp or GNUplot could be integrated to plot directly from AUF_sim.exe file.
